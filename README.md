# Songbirds Cage

This project is only an idea to make Songbirds' map creation easier. [Songbirds](https://johnbattle.itch.io/songbird) is a role playing game I discovered [here](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality).

Map creation is pretty simple: you have to select an artist you love. It doesn't matter music genre, group, band, singer... Then, you have to select 10 songs from that artist, and have to create a 3x3 dungeon by mixing that song list. How? Just read lyrics, or listening to that songs, or whatever... You have to be inspired, to create multiple rooms related to songs. It's okay if you drop songs from that list, or if you use one song through more than one room. No worries. 

I leave you the book example [here](https://github.com/Alex-CL/songbirds-cage/tree/master/example). Take a look, because author explains it better than me :sweat_smile:

The mechanics are kind of weird, but I love this game! :D
